Hello! This is a program that would help you to organize your time

After you fill your events for day and time when it ends,
you would be able to see:
- How many time is there for event to begin
- If it's already started, you might see how many time is there until the end.

Cool, hah\
You no more need to count time when your lesson at school or in university ends,
when your activities starts.
